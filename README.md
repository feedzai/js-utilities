## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and
should be installed as one of your project's `dependencies`:

```
npm install --save-dev @feedzai/js-utilities
```

## Usage

This is a collection of functions, utilities and react hooks. You'll find all available code in `src`.

The bundle is available as:

To import a piece of code into your javascript project just do:

```js
import { callIfExists, throwError, getLSItem, useConstant } from "@feedzai/js-utilities";
```

## Other Solutions

If you are aware of any please [make a pull request][prs] and add it here!
Again, this is a very specific-to-me solution.

- [Lightdash](https://github.com/FelixRilling/lightdash) - A small JavaScript utility library to complement lodash.
- [You might not need lodash](https://youmightnotneed.com/lodash) - It‚Äôs a great website, well crafted, battle tested and with a very skilled and active community contributing. The goal of that project is NOT to provide drop in replacements, but to show how to achieve similar functionalities in plain Javascript, to understand how things work behind the hood.
