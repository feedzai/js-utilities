title: groupBy
---
Creates an object composed of keys generated from the results of running
each element of `collection` through `iteratee`. The order of grouped values
is determined by the order they occur in `collection`. The corresponding
value of each key is an array of elements responsible for generating the
key. The iteratee is invoked with one argument: (value).

## API

```typescript
function groupBy<T, K>(collection: T[], iteratee: (element: T) => K): Record<string, T[]>;
```

### Usage

```typescript
import { groupBy } from "@feedzai/js-utilities";

groupBy([6.1, 4.2, 6.3], Math.floor)
// => { '4': [4.2], '6': [6.1, 6.3] }

```
