title: merge
---
This method is like `assign` except that it recursively merges own and
inherited enumerable string keyed properties of source objects into the
destination object.

Source properties that resolve to `undefined` are
skipped if a destination value exists.

Array and plain object properties are merged recursively.

Other objects and value types are overridden by
assignment.

Source objects are applied from left to right.

Subsequent sources overwrite property assignments of previous sources.

**Note:** This method mutates `object`.

## API

```typescript
type ObjTypeWithAny = Record<string, any>;

function merge<T extends ObjTypeWithAny, U extends ObjTypeWithAny>(
	target: T,
	source: U
): T & U;
```

### Usage

```typescript
import { merge } from "@feedzai/js-utilities";

const object = {
  'a': [{ 'b': 2 }, { 'd': 4 }]
}

const other = {
  'a': [{ 'c': 3 }, { 'e': 5 }]
}

merge(object, other)
// => { 'a': [{ 'b': 2, 'c': 3 }, { 'd': 4, 'e': 5 }] }

```
