title: uniqBy
---

This method is like `uniq` except that it accepts `iteratee` which is invoked for each element in `array` to generate the criterion by which uniqueness is computed. The order of result values is determined by the order they occur in the array. The iteratee is invoked with one argument: (value).

### API

```typescript
function uniqBy<T>(arr: T[], iteratee: Iteratee<T>): T[];
```

### Usage

```typescript
import { uniqBy } from "@feedzai/js-utilities";

uniqBy([2.1, 1.2, 2.3], Math.floor)
// => [2.1, 1.2]
```
