title: emitCustomEvent
---

Attaches data to a custom event.

The react way of handling events is to pass callbacks to child components.
This can become cumbersome when a child is several levels deep and one way to avoid passing callbacks deep is using Context.
However, Context or Redux are not meant for all use cases.

### API

```typescript
function emitCustomEvent<Source>(eventName: string, data?: Source): void;
```

### Usage

```typescript
import { emitCustomEvent } from "@feedzai/js-utilities";

function ComponentA() {
  const handleOnClick = useCallback((event) => {
    emitCustomEvent("my-custom-event", { name: event.target.textContent });
  }, []);

  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={handleOnClick}>Click Me</button>
  );
}
```
