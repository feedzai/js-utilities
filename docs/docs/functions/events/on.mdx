title: on

Adds an event listener for events with a specified type attribute value. The callback parameter defines the function to be executed when the event is dispatched.

The options parameter specifies listener-specific settings. For compatibility, this can be a boolean. If true, it behaves as if the value were specified as options' capture.

When options' capture is set to true, the callback won't be invoked during the BUBBLING_PHASE of the event's eventPhase attribute value. If false (or not provided), the callback won't be invoked during the CAPTURING_PHASE of the event's eventPhase attribute value. In either case, the callback will be invoked if the event's eventPhase attribute value is AT_TARGET.

Setting options' passive to true indicates that the callback won't cancel the event by calling preventDefault().

When options' once is set to true, the callback will only be invoked once, after which the event listener will be removed.

If an AbortSignal is passed for options' signal, the event listener will be removed when the signal is aborted.

The event listener is added to the target's event listener list and won't be appended if it already exists with the same type, callback, and capture.

### API

```typescript
function on<T extends EventTarget>(
  obj: T | null,
  ...args:
    | Parameters<T["addEventListener"]>
    | [string, EventListenerOrEventListenerObject | CallableFunction, ...any]
): void;
```

### Usage

```typescript
import { on } from "@feedzai/js-utilities";

function callback(event) {
  event.stopPropagation();
}

// Attach event to DOM element
on(document.querySelector("h1"), "click", callback)

```
