title: memo
---
Creates a memoized function. The returned function will only execute the source function when no value has previously been computed. If a ttl (milliseconds) is given previously computed values will be checked for expiration before being returned.


## API

```typescript
function memo<TFunc extends (...args: any) => any>(func: TFunc, options?: {
    key?: Func<any, string>;
    ttl?: number;
}): TFunc;
```

### Usage

```typescript
import { memo } from '@feedzai/js-utilities'

const timestamp = memo(() => Date.now())

const now = timestamp()
const later = timestamp()

now === later // => true
```
