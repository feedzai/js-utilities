title: random

Produces a random number between the inclusive lower and upper bounds.
If only one argument is provided a number between 0 and the given number is returned.
If floating is true, or either lower or upper are floats, a floating-point number is returned instead of an integer.

## API

```typescript
function random(lower?: number, upper?: number | boolean, floating?: boolean): number;
```

```typescript
import { random } from '@feedzai/js-utilities';

random(0, 5)
// => an integer between 0 and 5

random(5)
// => also an integer between 0 and 5

random(5, true)
// => a floating-point number between 0 and 5

random(1.2, 5.2)
// => a floating-point number between 1.2 and 5.2
