title: usePageVisibility

Detects when the user's page visibility changes.
The Page Visibility API provides events you can watch for to know when a document becomes
visible or hidden, as well as features to look at the current visibility state of the page.

This is especially useful for saving resources and improving performance by letting
a page avoid performing unnecessary tasks when the document isn't visible.

This can happen when, for example:
a) A site has an image carousel that shouldn't advance to the next slide unless the user is viewing the page.
b) An application showing a dashboard of information doesn't want to poll the server for updates when the page isn't visible.
c) A page wants to detect when it is being prerendered so it can keep accurate count of page views
d) A site wants to switch off sounds when a device is in standby mode (user pushes power button to turn screen off)

## API

```typescript
function usePageVisibility(handlerCallback: (isVisible: boolean) => void, delay?: number): void;
```

### Usage

```tsx
import { usePageVisibility } from '@feedzai/js-utilities/hooks';

function App() {
  // When the user changes tabs, save the written note draft
  usePageVisibility((isVisible) => {
    if (!isVisible) {
      saveNoteDraft();
    }
  });

 // Wait two seconds before saving the written note draft
 usePageVisibility((isVisible) => {
   if (!isVisible) {
     saveNoteDraft();
   }
 }, 2000);
}
```
