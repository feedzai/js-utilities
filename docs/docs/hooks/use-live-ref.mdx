title: useLiveRef
---
Creates a `React.RefObject` that is constantly updated with the incoming value.

React's useRef hook, primarily used for accessing DOM nodes or React elements, has another valuable application: stabilizing references.

By wrapping volatile references in a stable container, useRef allows developers to grant dependencies immunity to change, which is particularly useful when you don't want hooks to trigger on every variable change.

This technique is especially beneficial when working with hooks like useEffect. For instance, when dealing with side effects that depend on changing variables, using useRef can prevent unnecessary re-evaluations and ensure  more consistent behavior. A custom hook like useLiveRef can be implemented to provide a stable reference to changing values, offering finer control over when hooks are re-evaluated without compromising the integrity of dependency arrays or ESLint rules.

## API

```typescript
function useLiveRef<T>(value: T): MutableRefObject<T>;
```

### Usage

```tsx
import { useLiveRef } from '@feedzai/js-utilities/hooks';

function Component({ prop }) {
  const PROP_REF = useLiveRef(prop);
}
```
